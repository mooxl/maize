     ```

### Deployment

#### Option 1: Netlify Deployment

The easiest way to deploy your frontend is using Netlify:

1. Push your code to a Git repository
1. Connect your repository to Netlify
1. Add the environment variables
1. Configure the build settings:
   - Build command: `npx convex deploy --cmd 'npm run build'`
   - Publish directory: `dist`
1. Deploy!

#### Option 2: Self-hosted Docker Deployment

You can also self-host your frontend using Docker:

1. Make sure your `.env` is populated with the correct credentials.

1. Build the Docker image:
```bash
docker build -t your-app-name .
```

1. Run the container:
```bash
docker run -p 80:80 your-app-name
```

The Docker setup includes:
- Multi-stage build for smaller image size
- Nginx for serving static files
- Optimized caching and compression
- Security headers
- Health check endpoint

## Development

- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run typecheck` - Run TypeScript type checking
